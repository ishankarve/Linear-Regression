The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. \n",

        "1.   In the dataset that some of the variables like 'weathersit' and 'season' have values as 1, 2, 3, 4 which have specific labels associated with them (as described in the data dictionary). These numeric values associated with the labels may indicate that there is some order to them - which is actually not the case. So, it is advisable to convert such feature values into categorical string values before proceeding with model building.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  The column 'yr' has two values 0 and 1 indicating the years 2018 and 2019 respectively. Since these bike-sharing systems are slowly gaining popularity, the demand for these bikes is increasing every year proving that the column 'yr' might be a good variable for prediction. So think twice before dropping it. \n"
